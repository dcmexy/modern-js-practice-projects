# Book List

A functional Loan Calculator implemented to practice **OOP Concepts**, **DOM manipulation** and **Local Storage**

Implementation of this project has been done in two flavours:

- Using standard ES5 functions and object literals (app.js)
- Using ES6+ Classes (app_es6.js)

Functionality of both approaches remain exactly the same.

External resources used include [Foundation 6.3](https://get.foundation/) CSS framework
